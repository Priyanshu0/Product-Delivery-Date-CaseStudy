This is a Case Study solving the problem of predicting the accurate delivery date of products in the Supply Chain Management use case

**Problem Statement**
The following hypothetical dataset simulates product shipments from company facilities to US customers for
a span of 8 months.
The problem statement is as follows â€“ How do we give an accurate estimate of the final delivery date
to our customers?
Instead of prescribing a strict approach we would leave it up to you to decide what kind of machine
learning approach you would want to take. The goal of the exercise is not just building an accurate
model (although it would be nice!) but to understand how you approach quantitative problems.
At the core of it, this is a predictive modelling challenge. Although, you may decide if you want to treat it
as a classification/regression problem.
